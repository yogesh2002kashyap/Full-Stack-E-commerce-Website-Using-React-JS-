This is Full-stack-E-commerce-Project.
this bookstore will feature an admin dashboard for managing books, a cash-on-delivery system, and a robust inventory management system. Users can easily add or remove products from their carts, proceed to checkout, and place orders. For admins, we'll create a secure admin dashboard accessible with a username and password. Admins will have the power to upload new books, manage and update existing book
information, and delete books as needed.

As a MERN stack project, I have used React for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the
backend, and MongoDB as our database. I have also leverage technologies like Tailwind CSS,
Redux, RTK Query Toolkit, Mongoose, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to enhance our project.
